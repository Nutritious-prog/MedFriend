Each patient has one Address, address instance is being created when patient is created (there cannot be any standalone addresses).
When pateint is created Address is created and they are connected by one to one relation.
When we want to create an instance of an appointment we need patient (one to one) and treatment(one to many).
Treatments are premade and when we are creating new appointment we can only select treatments from our premade set.
So when we create an appointment we fill in the pateints details and from them we will create a new patient
(or select existing one from drop down menu). Then we select certain treatments and with this information we can create an instance
of appointment.
